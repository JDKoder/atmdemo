ATM DEMO

A quick and dirty demo project incorporating a lot of freshly learned lessons about python and MongoDB.

While the accounts are persisted, the contents of the machine is not, so ending and restarting the application will refill the machine 
with $10,000.

All logs are output to runtime.log in the runtime directory.

After the build is succesful start the container and expose the necessary ports.

	docker run -it -d --name atmdemo atmdemo:1.0 /bin/bash

Finally, you may attach into the container and run the program

	docker container exec -it atmdemo /bin/bash
	cd /demo
	python3 main.py

INSTRUCTIONS FOR RUNNING NATIVELY
